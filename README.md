Python_MachineLearning_KNearestNeighbors
This notebook contains the KNN -  K Nearest Neighbors algorithm implementation
This notbook 
1. Reads a Panda Dataframe
2. Standardize the Variables
3. Transforms the features to a scaled version
4. Uses train_test_split to split your data into a training set and a testing set
5. Uses KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
6. Predicts and Evaluates the model
7. Chooses the right K Value using elbow method
8. Retrains the model using new K value
9. Verifies the precision is impoved
